OS/IDE used: iOS, VSCode

Instructions for running executables: Project run in VScode can be compiled by using cmake. This can be completed by compiling all with cmake ./, make command, and the terminal command such as ./project2-cs5330 pic.0061.jpg olympus feature multihistogram 1108. Note: due to the way my program was set up, the command line inputs for feature and 1108 are unchanging. The first few commands are:
1.  ./project2-cs5330 pic.0747.jpg olympus feature baseline 1108
2. ./project2-cs5330 pic.0747.jpg olympus feature histogram 1108


Testing extensions: To test the extensions, they are done with the same terminal commands above. An example could be done with ./project2-cs5330 pic.0031.jpg Olympus feature xsobeltexture 1108 or ./project2-cs5330 pic.0031.jpg Olympus feature ysobeltexture 1108.


Travel days: not using any travel days.
