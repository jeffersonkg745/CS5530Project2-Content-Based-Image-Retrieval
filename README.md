Project 2 : Content based image retrieval included challenges for spatial and color comparison between images. The challenges in this project included: matching two photos based on RGB pixels, matching images based on histograms, matching images using multiple histograms, comparing images based on a full color image histogram and full texture histogram, and making a custom design . Overall, the project was using different approaches to compare images using openCV functions and used filters created in Project 1.
